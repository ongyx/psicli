Welcome to the repo for psiman, a frontend for psilib that uses the [psidex](https://github.com/sn3ksoftware/psidex) system.

Platforms supported:

| Platform  | Version of psiman(cli-wrapper) |

(More platforms will be added as needed.)
# Dependencies
psiman, of course, requires Python 3.5+.
It only requires stlib that comes with Python 3.5+ and the requests library (preinstalled on Pythonista and Libterm), so it should work out of the box.
For Pythonista, [StaSh](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) is required to run psiman.
Install with `import requests as r; exec(r.get('https://bit.ly/get-stash').text)`.
# Installation
## Libterm/Pythonista:
If you are on Pythonista, launch a StaSh instance first (launch_stash.py and press the play button).
Download the installer and run it.
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sn3ksoftware/psilib/master/install.py
python install.py
```

Configuration files are, by default, stored at `~/Documents/.psicfg`.

# P.S
The code from [spkg for Libterm](https://github.com/sn3ksoftware/sandpkg/tree/testing) was _heavily_ modified to use the json-based `psidex` system.
Its original source code, including the psiman package manager, is under the MIT License.
