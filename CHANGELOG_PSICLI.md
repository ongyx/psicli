# CHANGELOG
### psicli v0.3.0-alpha:
- psiman has been renamed to psiCLI, to differentiate it from psiclient (ywangd's GUI tool). Also because it is a command-line interface.
- The fetch command has been moved to [update]. Running [psicli fetch] now downloads a package to the current directory without installing it.

### psiman v0.2.1-alpha:
- Better formatting for ywangd-standard package.json files.

### psiman v0.2.0-alpha:
- Added psicheck function to check if local psilib version is compatible.
- Nicer help/credits screen.
- Commands now use actual words (install, remove, etc.)
- Added support for new commands in psilib (listrepo, search)
- Easter eggs???

### psiman v0.1.1-alpha:
- Added prettyprint function to format psilib output better.

### psiman v0.1.0-alpha:
- Initial release for the cli-wrapper around psilib.
